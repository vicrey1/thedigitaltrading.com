      <p>THE DIGITAL TRADING Capital Management, LP ("THE DIGITAL TRADING") is a fully managed investment platform that allows individuals aged 18 and above to invest in professionally structured portfolios powered by proprietary systems, including the AURA engine.</p>
        <p>While all investments involve some degree of market risk, THE DIGITAL TRADING offers a principal protection mechanism on user-deposited funds. In the event of a loss due to market volatility or system-driven trades, THE DIGITAL TRADING will absorb the financial loss and ensure that the user's original invested capital is preserved.</p>
        <p>This guarantee is made possible through THE DIGITAL TRADING's internal reserve structure, risk-balancing strategies, and performance-based insurance coverage, which is designed to cushion against short-term market downturns and systemic anomalies in the algorithmic model.</p>
      <p>Please note: Returns on investment may vary, and performance is not guaranteed beyond the original capital amount. Withdrawals, early exits, or terms outside standard investment cycles may affect eligibility for principal protection.</p>
      <p>By using the platform, investors agree to the terms of service and understand that THE DIGITAL TRADING assumes full responsibility for loss mitigation under its risk-backed capital structure.</p>
